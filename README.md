# DarziFlow Backend

DarziFlow is a **garment production management system** designed to streamline collaboration between clients, supervisors, QC officers, and admins in the textile industry.  
This repository contains the **backend API** for DarziFlow, built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT** authentication.  

The backend is designed with **role-based access control (RBAC)** to support multiple user roles:
- Moderator (platform owners with full system control)
- Admin (manages departments, orders, and supervisors)
- Supervisor (manages production stages and daily wage workers)
- QC Officer (quality verification at each stage)
- Client (order tracking and feedback)
